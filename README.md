# Gama-X

A alternative for old non-logical dsl (domain static language), its _logical, faster, optimized_ and way more _lightweighted_.

## why this language?

because, it have these:

- loops
- mathimaticals
- conditions `if-else`
- Pre-Processor commands
- syntax of `assembly`

at total, its a complete language but not a native one, in other words, Gama-X is developed for machine with its driver!

_note:_ its executable only for machine with _Gama-X driver_.

### Time complexity

contrary to G-Code, this one, has **O(1)** time complexity, in other words, always runs each line on constant time, this is best thing for _real-time_ machines!

_note:_ `G-Code` has **O(n log(n))** time complexity, its not designed for _real-time_ machines!

### Easy to design driver

to writing a driver for your own machine, just follow these steps:

1. Read output file.
2. Seperate parts and use them.
3. you are done.
